// variables are temporary place holders which can keep a value somewhere stored safely in memory.
// we can either make a variable Permanent meaning Value will not change or we can make it Temporary.
// there are two types:
// Let: to define a variable, we should use Let keyword.
// Const: by using Const keyword, whatever value we assign then it cannot be changed or modified.
// var: var keyword is also used to define variable. Prefer not to use this because of Block & Functional Scope
